        <p>This exhibition only touches the surface of how medieval badges express the visual culture and communication which developed in the Middle Ages, yet in the observation of just three badges, there is still a wealth of information uncovered from these unassuming and deteriorating objects. The reuse of common symbols are combined in a variety of different ways to create a context which makes the origin and meaning of each badge clear. Through analysing the 3D representations of these objects which otherwise cannot be handled, an authentic tactile, archival experience is replicated which allows for in-depth analysis of the badges at both the macroscopic and microscopic level. Angles and details that could only be expressed through numerous pictures are instead made accessible through a singular, complete form. And, in understanding the form of these once common objects, we gain a greater ability to spot them in other circumstances, gaining enhanced context about not only the symbolism of these objects but how they were presented and used.</p>
        <p>The following is a list of both web-based and traditional resources that can be used to learn more about these fascinating small badges that were so present in medieval life.</p>

                <p>This video was produced by the Digital Pilgrim Project and demonstrates the most common method of producing medieval badges. Not only is it useful for understanding how these badges were produced, but it also aids in understanding exactly how they ended up being so widely distributed by demonstrating their quick production time.</p>

                <li><a href="https://kunera.nl/en">Kunera Database</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Kunera database is a continuous project underway at Radboud University to collect, document, and digitize medieval badges. Currently, their online database has records of 26477 badges and includes an interactive map which plots both pilgrimage sites and find locations of the badges in their collection.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>This is the site for a recent SSHRC-funded project dedicated to the research of medieval badges, examining the function of them in everyday life. It features informative blog posts by the researchers involved in the project, as well as a summary of select current resources related to formal research and experiential learning with medieval badges.</p>

                <p>This is the entirety of the <em>Digital Pilgrim</em> badge collection on Sketchfab, which includes more badges related to St Thomas Becket, as well as a handful of secular badges. Through this collection, one can also access the British Museum&#39;s Sketchfab account as a whole and view the other 3D models that have been created from objects in their archive.</p>

                <p>This is the entirety of the book which is discussed in the final section of this exhibition; it is an illuminated account of the life of King Louis IX, the only French king to be canonized, commissioned by Charles II of Bourbon, a former Archibishop of Lyon. Although the text may be unreadable for those who do not know French, there are numerous artistic renditions of badges featured in the illustrations which offer a point of reference regarding the place badges held in the daily life of medieval Catholic culture.</p>
