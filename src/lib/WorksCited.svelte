</ul>
<p>In this study of religion and art, Mellinkoff highlights the beliefs surrounding good and evil as understood in medieval Catholic tradition and relates this to the usage of symbols within the forms of art produced in this time period. It is a point of reference for both Catholic belief in relation to demonic entities, and also the meaning and use of various motifs in medieval works such as badges.</p>
